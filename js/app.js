Now Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is quite similar, except each square in the field is actually small game of Tic Tac Toe. Only if you win the small game, you get the square of the big game. The goal again is to get three (big) squares in a row. Further rules will be explained below. This game requires quite a bit of strategy because you can influence which of the big squares your opponent has to play in.')
